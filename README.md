# Simulation-Law-of-Large-Numbers-
Testing out stochastic simulations to visualise the Law of Large Number (LLN) as one of the foundations of statistics and probability.   

## HOW IT'S MADE 
Languages used: R verion (4.5.1)    
Environemnt: RStudio

## METHODS AND TECHNIQUES  
**Function creation**  
 Defined a new simdivis() that returns a 1 if our number is divisible by 3, 5 or 9 and 0 if not.  
**Seed**   
This sets our seed for reproducability   
**Experiment**   
Repeat thus the tosses 50, 2000 and 10,000 times using the replicate() function and get an average of each of the tosses  
**Vizualisation**   
Create a scatter-plot to show the average of each repeated experiment against the abline() of true calculated probability.
